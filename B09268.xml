            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>With your Lordships favour,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>If the subversion of the fundamentals of Faith be Heresie, why not as well the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the fundamental Laws, Treason? Shall it be Treason to destroy the Kings Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister? and shall that be none that destroyes his protector? For the Law protects the King, aswell as the King the Lawes: and if Lawes did not subsidiate Princes, Kingdoms would totter as foundationlesse: nay they are indeed, the very subsistence of Kings.</p>
            <p>Let it be supposed, though not granted, that no one particular make it Treason, may not many and successive Acts amount it to that height? One graine of poyson is not mortall, but many together are. Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sheepe for once is but a Trespasse, but acted a second time is Felony by Statute. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall of the Oath of Supremacy is at first not capitall; but refus'd againe, by statute is made Treason. And to my weake understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, my Lords, this cleerly shewes the mind of the Law: one ill act of waving the Law, may be but out of rashnesse, out of Ignorance; but a perpetuated practice, shewes a prepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191892:3"/> malice, and murther thus acted by the 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is Treason.</p>
            <p>Be it there be no statute or Common-Law in expresse to make it so, yet necessary infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, if they be not certainties, are next them; and if the deputed Judge or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath power in the businesse of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to make the sway arbitrary, where Law is positive, I know not but hee may doe the same in the businesse of the soveraigne; so it may come to pull the Soveraignty from the Prince, and place it on his substitute, and whether this be Treason or no, I leave to your Lordships consideration.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>de non apparentibus, &amp; non existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, eadem est Ratio,</hi> But my Lords, to make this Treason, is not unapparent: a partiall eye will not find it, but he that lookes, <hi>Intuitu serio,</hi> may see even the Triple Gerion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in it, for it cannot be but there is <hi>Laesa Respub. Lex Maiestas,</hi> the Common-wealth is oppressed, the Lawes are supprest, the Prince is scandal'd in act, and subjected by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his Denious determinations: and therefore <hi>I</hi> shall without admiration tell you where this fire hath layen those hundred of yeares he speaketh of, even (my Lords) in the honester behaviour of other Ministers of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:191892:3"/> State, who have not beene injurious against the Lawes, and there still had it beene buried, if his owne nefarious actions had not un-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it, and fuel'd it a new.</p>
            <p>Nor can your Sentence be before promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, since even your renowned Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have already declared it Treason; though not by a particular Statute in termes: yet by a demonstrative practice, which if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would not have beene willingly blind, had beene Buoy enough to keepe him from that Anchor of us all, which now must either hurt it selfe, or else split him, the Parliament whose Courses left upon Record cannot be taken for under water workes, so that a very easie honesty and common morallity (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Revelation) might have serv'd as the red Crosse and the Bill, to have warn'd him from this plague of Legicide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> shall beg as hard as his Lordship, that you have regard to your selves, for if upon him (by whose authority, Peeres shall be sentenc'd to be shot, Noble cutb'd &amp; coop'd up, Lawes subverted, Freehold disposed of out of the Courts, Grants under the Royall Seale extrajudicially disanul'd and what may be profit of, Monopoliz'd) you set not some everlasting Character to deter the like sront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:191892:4"/> attempts; <hi>I</hi> know not but the next Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may subjugate your dearest freedomes, and as remedilesse you may then complaine, as those who now doe suffer, and have not yet found a redresse.</p>
            <p>My Lords under favour, your providence may be short; if it reach but to burning of Bookes: a fire of dead leaves will be too weake a fuell for a warning Beacon: <hi>A</hi> living Author made exemplary will afford a Taller flame, and if there were no other Law, that of Retaliation could not but be just; an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary sentence, were but plowing with his owne Heyfer, Who striving to seclude the Lawes, would inferre a kind of legall Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, from a brest that is a Libertine. And therefore your Lordships, <hi>I</hi> perswade my selfe, will thinke it mightily fit, to cast this <hi>Ionas</hi> over board, who has occasioned all these stormes, indangered all the sacred ship of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and by flying the plaine speaking Law, has dar'd by his Imperious Vote, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe even all the bold attemps of Ancestry.</p>
            <p>It is some comfort to us, that in 240 years, we have had no use of these venerable, (though by him reviled for musty) Records. The Common-wealth has had the fewer enemies. And if they worke now but a merited opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:191892:4"/>
               <hi>I</hi> hope it may be 500 yeares ere any of so bold a brow, shall desperatly againe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to awaken them.</p>
            <p>And if his Lordship be not made a president for punishment: I know not but hee may prove a President for example, to animate others of a Vafrous and presuming braine, to take up the same way from a pleasurable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, to doome both Nobles, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, into a State of deep calamity. And so your Lordships lenity to him; may by indulgence wound a future multitude. His many crimes which you have heard fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will immortallize your Peerage for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Justice. The learned Orator has antiently told us, that <hi>Non potest cuiquam male de Repub. merenti, justa esse causa.</hi> And though it be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, it cannot be unrighteous, for <hi>Hoe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant Leges, Hoe volunt; in columem esse Civium Conjunctionem, quam qui dirimunt, eos morte, exilio, vinculis, damno, coercent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus every man will know what channell to steere in, what roks to avoyd, what he is not to doe, what he is not to say for feare of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such paines.</p>
            <p>Thus men of honest wisedome, will be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of keeping in the plaine rode of the Law, and never hazard (by crossing through
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:191892:5"/> untroden Thickets) either Honour, Issue, or fortune, to a losse. What his Maiestie may graciously intend to the pledge of his Sainct, will rest in his most Royall heart: Though <hi>I</hi> hope the want of a Midwife did not make her one, now his marryage within a moneth after her decease did ere make him account her so.</p>
            <p>And now (my Lords) wee shall humbly expect your Honorable Judgements, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you will be nobly pleased to defend those Lawes which have ever defended you, to have respect to your owne future liberty, and the safety of these flourishing Kingdomes: Then what ever your sentence be,</p>
